Download Rollo and run the example <a href="https://github.com/netskillzgh/rollo/blob/master/examples/hello_world.rs">hello_world</a> in Rust to launch the server.

Download this Unity project and Play.

You will see information in the console on both the server and Unity. There won't be any visual representation; the only purpose of this example is to show you how to communicate with the server.
